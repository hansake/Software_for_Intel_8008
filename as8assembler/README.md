The AS8 assembler for Intel 8008.
Needed to assemble the source code for the SCELBAL interpreter.

Got the source to AS8 (as8withRST.c) from Mike Willegal (thank you very much)
as it seemed to have disappered from Internet. Not sure if there are any
copyright for this code but there is nothing in the source code about copyright.
