The AS8 assembler for Intel 8008 by Thomas E. Jones.
Needed to assemble the source code for the SCELBAL interpreter.
http://www.willegal.net/scelbi/scelbal.html

Got the source to AS8 (as8withRST.c) from Mike Willegal (thank you very much).
Now also available at: http://petsd.net/as8.zip which also contains a copy
of the SCELBAL interpreter. 

Not sure if there is any copyright for the as8 code but there is nothing in the source code about copyright.
